## ðŸŸ¢ Beginner Level

### Goals:
- Understand basic programming concepts.
- Learn problem-solving techniques.
- Solve beginner-friendly problems consistently.

### Steps:
1. **Master a Programming Language**
   - Pick a language (C++,C,C# or Java are recommended).
   - Focus on syntax, input/output, and basic debugging.
   - Suggested resources:
     - [C++ Basics by GeeksforGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/c-plus-plus/)
   
2. **Learn Core Concepts**
   - Variables and data types
   - Conditionals and loops
   - Functions and recursion
   - Arrays and strings
   - Basic sorting algorithms (Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort)

3. **Solve Problems**
   - Start with beginner problems on:
     - [Codeforces (Div 3)](https://codeforces.com/contest/1337/problem/A)
     - [LeetCode Easy Problems](https://leetcode.com/problemset/all/?difficulty=EASY)
     - [HackerRank Warm-up Challenges](https://www.hackerrank.com/)

4. **Practice Regularly**
   - Solve at least 10 beginner problems.
   - Track progress and analyze errors.

- Improve problem-solving efficiency.
- Participate in rated contests.

### Steps:
1. **Learn Algorithms**
   - Sorting and searching (Merge Sort, Binary Search)
   - Prefix sum and sliding window techniques
   - Two-pointer and greedy approaches
   - Basic dynamic programming (e.g., Fibonacci, knapsack)

2. **Master Essential Data Structures**
   - Stacks and queues
   - Hash maps and sets
   - Linked lists and binary trees

3. **Participate in Contests**
   - Begin participating in contests on:
     - [Codeforces (Div 2 & 3)](https://codeforces.com/)
     - [AtCoder Beginner Contests](https://atcoder.jp/)
   - Solve problems during and after contests to learn.

4. **Solve 30+ Intermediate Problems**
   - Try problems on:
     - [LeetCode Medium Problems](https://leetcode.com/problemset/all/?difficulty=MEDIUM)
     - [HackerRank Data Structures Challenges](https://www.hackerrank.com/domains/tutorials/10-days-of-code)

## ðŸ”´ Advanced Level

### Goals:
- Master complex algorithms and optimization techniques.
- Rank higher in global competitions.
- Work on speed and accuracy.

### Steps:
1. **Learn Advanced Concepts**
   - Graph algorithms (Dijkstra, Floyd-Warshall, Minimum Spanning Tree)
   - Segment trees and Fenwick trees
   - Advanced dynamic programming (Bit masking, DP on trees)
   - Game theory and combinatorics
   - Number theory (Prime factorization, Modular arithmetic)

2. **Compete Regularly**
